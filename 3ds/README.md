# 3DVier
A Connect Four clone for Nintendo 3DS.

## Compilation

To build 3DVier from source, you need devkitPro installed, along with devkitARM, libctru, Citro2D and Citro3D. To get these you can run `pacman -S 3ds-dev --noconfirm`. Now that you have everything installed, you just need to run clone the repository and run `make 3ds` in the root directory, or directly run `make` in the 3ds directory. You will find your `3DVier.3dsx` and `3DVier.cia` build at the end inside the current directory.
